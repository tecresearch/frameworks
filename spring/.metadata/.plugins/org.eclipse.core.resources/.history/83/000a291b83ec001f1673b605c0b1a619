The Spring Bean lifecycle is a fundamental concept in the Spring Framework. It describes the sequence of steps that a Spring-managed bean goes through from its instantiation to its destruction. Below is a simple Spring program that demonstrates the lifecycle of a Spring bean using the InitializingBean, DisposableBean interfaces, and custom init and destroy methods.

Steps in the Spring Bean Lifecycle:
Instantiation: The bean is instantiated by the Spring container.

Population of Properties: Dependencies are injected into the bean.

Bean Post-Processing: Custom logic can be applied using BeanPostProcessor.

Initialization: The afterPropertiesSet() method (from InitializingBean) or a custom init method is called.

Bean is Ready: The bean is ready to be used.

Destruction: The destroy() method (from DisposableBean) or a custom destroy method is called before the bean is destroyed.
